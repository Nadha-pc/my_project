While working with PyWinAssistant, I encountered the following error:

Exception in thread Thread-1 (listen_thread):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Program Files\Python312\Lib\threading.py", line 1073, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "C:\Program Files\Python312\Lib\threading.py", line 1010, in run
    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
  File "C:\Users\nihal\pywinassistant\core\assistant.py", line 432, in listen_thread
    assistant(message)
  File "C:\Users\nihal\pywinassistant\core\driver.py", line 253, in assistant
    assistant_goal = imaging(window_title=app_name, additional_context=additional_context, screenshot_size='Full screen')['choices'][0]['message']['content']



Solution:
I modified the driver.py file by adding  Debugging for imaging() Response .Before accessing 'choices', we now print the full response to understand if it's returning the expected data.

1)Added Debugging to See the Full Response
Before using 'choices', we now print the full response to check if it contains the expected data.
print("Imaging Response:", response)
why this was added 
If imaging() fails, it might return an empty {} or None, which can cause an error. Printing the response helps us understand what's going wrong.

2) Added a Safety Check to Prevent Errors
Before accessing response['choices'][0]['message']['content'], we now check if 'choices' exists and is not empty:
if response and isinstance(response, dict) and 'choices' in response and response['choices']:
    assistant_goal = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
else:
    print("Error: 'choices' is missing or empty in response:", response)
    assistant_goal = "Default response due to missing 'choices'."
Why this was added
If 'choices' is missing, the script wonâ€™t crash.
Instead, it prints an error message and sets a default response, so the program keeps running.

After making this change, the issue was resolved, and everything is working fine.
